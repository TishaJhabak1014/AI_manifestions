This function returns an object, called `bot`, which is further used in the program. You may set the name of your choice. In our case, we have set it to `Jordan`.\n",

        "    - The second argument is the custom data we want to train. This custom data takes the form of a Python `list`. The first element of the list is the question and the second element is its answer (lines 10-13). You may train the chatbot with as much specific custom data as you want.\n",
